          I blend front-end development, UX strategy, and design — but more
          than that, I craft clean, thoughtful code. Every project is an
          opportunity to build something intuitive, efficient, and built to
          last, with both performance and user experience in mind.

          Beyond the code, I bring a strong set of soft skills that keep
          projects running smoothly. I adapt quickly to new challenges,
          learn on the fly, and stay dependable under pressure. With a sharp
          eye for time management and a knack for critical thinking, I
          handle complex tasks with ease. Collaboration is at the heart of
          how I work—I thrive in team settings, value clear communication,
          and bring a positive, solutions-focused mindset to every project.
